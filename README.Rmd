## Introduction
According to the NOAA,  global CO2 levels were at 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1959. Just 6 decades later, they have reached 417 ppm, as of October 2021. Most of the greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere each year is driven by fossil fuel combustion. Although the world has made efforts to shift to renewable energy sources like wind, hydropower, and solar, drastic changes need to be made in order for humanity to avoid the worst of climate change. 

Global warming can lead to infectious diseases, changes in agricultural productivity, respiratory ailments, environment degredation, and even deteriorate the ecosystem of different species which in turn can affect how we live our lives. Over the last century, the average surface temperature of the Earth has increased by about 1.0 degree Fahrenheit. One of the main drivers of global warming is energy consumption, and more specifically fossil fuel combustion. Our group is interested in studying the different types of  energy consumption in different countries around the world to see who is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels versus who is making progress towards renewables. What do these trends look like over time in comparison to fossil fuel usage? After finding an ideal data set, we decided to narrow our search, understanding how fossil fuels and renewable energies change overtime for different countries, focusing on the energy consumption as well as the energy consumption per capita. 

The dataset we have chosen is World Energy Consumption, a dataset consisting of key metrics of energy usage (primary energy, per capita, growth rates, energy mix, electricity mix, and other metrics) from Kaggle. This data set is part of Our World in Data, which seeks to collect data and research the world's largest problems. Initially, the data set contained 122 columns of variables, and over 17,000 observations for each country from 1900 to the present. There were many observations which had “NA" as their entry. 

Because there were over 100 columns and over 17,000 observations, we wanted to focus our findings on a few specific countries as well as a few specific variables. During the cleaning process, we focused on creating a data frame that included country, year, and energy consumption from wind, solar, other renewables, nuclear, and fossil fuels. After creating this data frame, we noticed that we still had a lot of information and decided that it was best to look at how energy consumption has changed in the past two-three decades for a few developed and industrialized countries. 

## Methodology
While looking at our research topic we began by making a simple comparison graph, looking at the development of solar energy in the past 20 years for a set of a few developed countries of interest. After seeing a few unexpected trends, we decided to make leaflet plots as well as a comparison graph that focused on looking at the fossil fuel consumption for China and the United States. Our leaflet focused on renewable energy consumption for 1900 and 2018 (the most recent comprehensive global data in our dataset). After making this visualization, our group was interested in looking at how a variety of energy sources would differ for a list of countries. Generating these visualizations, we noticed that because we had a list of a lot of different countries, it was hard to identify which line matched with which country based on our key. As a result, we added an additional feature to our visualization, giving the information of country and value when highlighting a specific data point in the graph. The same ideas were also implemented in our leaflet of the world, showing the renewable energy share between countries across the world in 1990 and 2018. We also decided to create a faceted bar graph of the different types of energy consumption each country has used in the past 20 years. Through these visualizations we observed that because of the two leading countries in energy consumption, we created a visualization that focused on the two countries (China and the United States). After understanding the story the data could tell us, we decided to create a prediction model to help predict energy consumption for the leading countries in future years because China and the United States are definitely the most influential countries in terms of affecting the environment and the world. 

## Findings + Discussion
Our linear regression models for the USA and China have r^2 values of 0.141 and 0.946, respectively.  This is surprising because upon visual inspection of the plot with both predicted and actual data, the USA regression line closely follows the data, which appears to be just as if not more linear than the China data.  In 1990, the USA consumed about twice as much fossil fuel as China.  In 2018, the USA consumed about ⅔ the amount of fossil fuel as china.  By 2030, China is predicted to consume about twice as much fossil fuel as the USA.  Perhaps China will consider utilizing a higher proportion of renewable sources as their energy demands continue to grow. Our figures show that China and the United States consume the most energy, but have made little overall progress to diversity their energy consumption in comparison to countries like Finland. With that, our visualization show that smaller countries with less energy usage lead the charge in renewables, possibly because they do not have to generate as much to support their smaller populations. Our bar chart shows that renewable sources are generally evenly contributing to energy consumption in the US and China. Additionally, our figures show an interesting relationship between leaders in solar, wind, and nuclear which depends on whether we look at per capita, or overall generation. We can see that usually larger countries technically produce more renewable energy, but this makes up a much smaller percentage of their total energy consumption. If we look at per capita, we see that smaller countries are in fact leaders.
